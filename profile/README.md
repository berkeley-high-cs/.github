# Berkeley High Computer Science

This organization is for computer science students at Berkeley High. If you are

teacher about how to get added to to the organization and set up for whatever
class you are taking.

If you are a BHS student not currently taking any computer science course but
have a reason to want to join this organiation, or if you have any other
questions about computer science at Berkeley High, email [Peter
